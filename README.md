Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability caused by differences 
in the brain. People with ASD often have problems with social communication and interaction, 
and restricted or repetitive behaviours or interests. People with ASD may also have different 
ways of learning, moving, or paying attention. Autistic children often have strengths in noticing 
details and patterns. For example, some autistic children might learn letters, numbers and 
shapes more easily than typically developing children.
The main aim of the website AutMath can be to promote and support the learning 
and development of mathematical skills in individuals with autism. The website should be 
designed in a user-friendly and accessible manner, considering the unique characteristics and 
preferences of individuals with autism.
The main objectives of the project are:
• The website can provide adaptive learning resources and tools specifically designed to 
cater to the unique learning styles and needs of individuals with autism.
• It can offer interactive math lessons, tutorials, and exercises that adapt to the 
individual's pace, level of understanding, and preferred learning modalities.
• The website can incorporate visual aids such as diagrams, charts, and illustrations to 
help explain mathematical concepts and make them more accessible and 
understandable for individuals on the autism spectrum.
1.1 PURPOSE
• The main purpose of developing a website for individuals with autism is to provide 
them with a supportive and accessible online platform for acquiring knowledge, 
developing skills, and enhancing their educational experience.
• Instead of directly going to learning centres we can learn from home. 
 
2 SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY
The scope of this project is to create a web-based learning system to those people 
who are going through this autism. The system will be built using modern web technologies
such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript. This application makes it easier to the autism people who 
want to learn mathematical skills and who want to increase their concentration through puzzle 
games. By providing a comprehensive learning platform, the website can empower individuals 
with autism to take control of their own learning and foster a sense of independence
